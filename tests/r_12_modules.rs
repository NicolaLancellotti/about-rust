/*
If an item is public, it can be accessed through any of its parent modules.
If an item is private, it can be accessed only by its immediate parent module
and any of the parent’s child modules.

- The crate keyword refers to the current crate.
- Absolute paths begin with a crate name, where the keyword crate refers to the
current crate.
- A foo.rs and foo/ subdirectory may coexist; mod.rs is no longer needed when
placing submodules in a subdirectory.

Our preference is to specify absolute paths because it’s more likely to move
code definitions and item calls independently of each other.
